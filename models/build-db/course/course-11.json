The first thing you will learn is some&nbsp;<strong>basic information<\/strong>&nbsp;about ethical hacking&nbsp;and the different fields in penetration testing.<br><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This course is focused on the&nbsp;<strong>practical side of&nbsp;penetration<\/strong>&nbsp;testing without neglecting the theory behind each attack. Before jumping into penetration testing, you&nbsp;will first learn how to&nbsp;<strong>set up a lab and install needed software<\/strong>&nbsp;to practice penetration testing on your own machine. All the attacks explained in this course are launched against real devices in my lab.\r\n\r\n  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The course is structured in a way that will take you through the basics of linux, computer systems, networks and&nbsp;how devices communicate with each other. We will start by talking about how we can exploit these systems to carry out a number of powerful attacks. This course will take you&nbsp;<strong>from a beginner to a more advanced level -- <\/strong>by the time you finish, you will have knowledge about most penetration testing fields.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The course is divided into four main sections:\r\n\r\n  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">1.&nbsp;Network Penetration Testing -&nbsp;<\/em>This section will teach you how to test the security of networks, both wired and wireless. First, you will learn how networks work, basic network terminology and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:\r\n\r\n  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li><em>Pre-connection<\/em><strong>:<\/strong><em>&nbsp;<\/em>in this section, we still don't know much about penetration testing -- all we have is a computer with&nbsp;a wireless card. You will learn how&nbsp;<strong>gather&nbsp;information<\/strong>&nbsp;about the networks and computers around you and launch a number of attacks without a password, such as controlling the connections around you (ie:&nbsp;<strong>deny\/allow any device from connecting to any network<\/strong>). You will also learn how to&nbsp;<strong>create a fake access<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>point,<\/strong>&nbsp;attract users to connect to it and capture any important information they enter.<\/li><li><em>Gaining Access<\/em>: Now that you have gathered information about&nbsp;the networks around you and found your target, you will learn how to crack the key and gain access to your target network.&nbsp;In this section you will learn a&nbsp;<strong>number of methods to crack WEP\/WPA\/WPA2&nbsp;<\/strong>encryption.<\/li><li>&nbsp;<em>Post Connection<\/em>: Now you have the key to your target network and you can connect to it. In this section you will learn a number of<strong>&nbsp;powerful attacks<\/strong>&nbsp;that can be launched against the network and connected clients.

You will also learn&nbsp;how to&nbsp;<strong>exploit<\/strong>&nbsp;these weaknesses to gain full control over the target.

This is done by&nbsp;<strong>creating fake updates<\/strong>&nbsp;and serving them to the user or by&nbsp;<strong>backdoornig downloaded<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>files<\/strong>&nbsp;on the fly.
