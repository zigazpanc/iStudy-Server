Why?  - because I am so far a self-employed entrepreneuer, with passion to learn - but I work long time earning some money for constructing business plans, financial sheets for investment bank debts and UE funds applications for microcompanies of my area (smalltown in Poland, surrounded by lots of villages). As I see the syllabus of the course (comparing to the courses I have checked before - i.e. best MBA in Poland costs $15 thousands for 2 years - of slow-motion studying and travelling within my country, at the same time no good e-learning sets ) - and as I like the course content with added such easy way of communication - I will joyfully gather all my past skills and business abilities to work as a business multi-tool :) - I`m a half way through and it goes as I assumed. :) Opened mind, opened heart, little smile, multitasking eyes and hands, some pen and sheets of paper with a little assistance of Internet :) - that`s my favourite workshop :) So... - finally I have managed to achieve my goal! :) Two parts were little bit difficult for me, so I needed to concentrate and focus on the topic, what made me enthusiastic to search for more in my own language and check out for resources in Poland. Thanks a lot! I have made a big mind map of the course, so I can have all the process and knowledge possible to look at in just one eye-shot - with some little moves  of course ;)"

Please let me know what additional topics you think I should add to the course that are not covered in the course. Thanks again, Chris"
