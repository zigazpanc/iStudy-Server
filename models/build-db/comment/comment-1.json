In combination, Bret starts to talk much faster making it difficult to grasp the technical detail at the rate he's covering them.  (I suspect he was anxious to finish the course and publish.)  To compensate, I've had to backup often and re-listen 2 or even 3 times to what was said combined with frequent pauses to just read the screen content to better grasp the volume of advanced docker capabilities that's being rapidly covered.  Nonetheless, the course is still the most efficient/effective way I know to come up to speed on this new technology.  Hence, it remains 4 stars.  Nice job Bret."
