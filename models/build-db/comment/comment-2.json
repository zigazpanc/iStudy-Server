It was less about algorithms and more about structure and putting the pieces together. Web Development is a large field and Colt did a great job on focusing on the main important parts. He touches on html, css, frameworks, libraries, node.js, mongodb, git/github, heroku and complex JS topics towards the end. If someone asks me where can I learn how to create full stack websites as a beginner I will for sure recommend Colt's course as the first option. It gives you a solid foundation on how to create full stack web apps/sites. My skill level increased enormously I felt like I just turned Super Saiyan!!!!"

But it gives you lots of tools and all the knowledge you need to be a full stack developer - with a given (and modern) set of technology. You sure need to learn and watch out for new technologies - as in every other job. But you do learn a lot and you do it step by step, so it's feasible even if you have no experience at all. And this course surprised me regularly. From time to time I asked myself how could I do this or that and then - some hours later - I had the solution (i.e. how can I make my site accessible on the internet for everybody - but there is an app for that, too).The videos are really good, it is not some \"watch me code\" experience I saw in several other videos. There sure is code but the lessons are well-thought-out. And with lots of exercises and code alongs you really learn how stuff works... because if you only watch you won't learn much. You really see that Colt (and the other instructors) do like teaching very much. So I recommend this course to everybody who wants to learn web development."

    "content": "This course provides a fantastic foundation in web development. Of course it cannot provide the same intensity and job preparation as an in-person bootcamp but it can take you from an absolute zero-knowledge beginner to someone who can use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Node, Express, MongoDB etc. to make working web applications (and understand why they work). Its main strength is the quality of its instructors. Colt is obviously a talented, thoughtful and passionate teacher. He is excellent at explaining difficult concepts in accessible terms and has clearly put a great deal of thought into the design of the course. Not to mention that he's also funny and engaging. Later in the course Ian and Elie prove equally clear and helpful. Its other great strengths are its practicality and focus. There is much more emphasis on making applications that work rather than on abstract theory (though Colt does a great job of explaining the concepts you need to know and Elie's videos go into greater depth when it comes to JavaScript). By the end of the course you will have a great foundation in JavaScript and Node.js and will be able to use them to make real-world applications, not just to complete exercises. This focus on JavaScript means you get into much more depth than if you were to just jump around between languages and frameworks. There are still things that would be desirable in the course if it were to rival an actual coding bootcamp: the Git and Github section needs fleshing out (though Ian makes his Git course available for free); there could be more emphasis on APIs; it would be nice to also cover AJAX if not something as complex as Angular or React. My only real gripe with the course in its current form is that the videos for the YelpCamp project don't currently get as far through the refactoring as Colt originally promised. That said, Ian has been adding new material there on a regular basis so that problem is gradually going away. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this course, learned loads, and feel much more confident in my programming abilities. I would certainly recommend this course for anyone looking to get into web development."

    "content": "Colt's course is pretty well put together and I would recommend it to most students depending on what you look to get out of it. Will you gain a thorough understanding of full stack web development by the end of the course? Absolutely yes. Will you have the skills necessary to apply for and get a junior web dev position at a company? Probably not, but you're well on your way if that's your end goal. Will you have the skills necessary to reinforce your existing design-related job? Absolutely yes. I knocked a star off because of some quirks with the lectures that can make for a frustrating experience at times. First, Colt has a tendency to go too fast or too slow. Thankfully, it's video that can be rewound or paused. A bigger problem though is that Colt has a tendency, especially in the later videos of the YelpCamp project to jump around in his explanations. Ideally, it should follow: 1. State the problem. 2. Discuss the solution 3. Provide the solution 4. Discuss possible pitfalls and curveballs and possible solutions. In my experience watching the videos, Colt jumps from 1 to 4 to 3 to 2, which makes for a confusing experience. Another issue is that I wish there were more exercises, at least optional exercises, in the JavaScript sections. You get a code along and maybe one exercise, and then it's off to the next topic, which doesn't help students learn and reinforce methodologies. My last complaint is that it would have been nice for Colt to call out which file he's working in during the YelpCamp videos. The project gets fairly big in number of files towards the end and with some files in different paths having the same name, so I felt like I was wasting time checking and double checking to make sure I was following the video correctly.For those of you wondering how long it takes to complete the 43+ hours of content, I finished the course in 7 weeks working approximately 5 days a week at a minimum of 4 hours a day.Despite my complaints, I think Colt is an A+ instructor and I intend on enrolling in his mySQL course in the future."

There are many tech stacks for WebDev, the ones covered here are MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS.Ones suggestion is maybe add a section about a front-end framework like Angular/React/Vue, just to get your feet wet, then the alumn can take it from there. Also maybe add a section of the new HTML 5 tags and when to use them.That aside this is a great course and I recommend it to anyone who want to start a WebDev career or maybe to someone who has an idea for a site or web app.This course will not make a full fledged expert in WebDev but is great step to start and by the end of it you'll have a sound foundation to take it where you want to go!"

I had learned HTML, CSS and a handful of JS back in the 90s and dabbled with Dreamweaver. Even the sections I had already known were great refreshers before plunging into the content that was new.Colt, Ian and Elie all are very well spoken and articulate, but never over-complicate the lessons. All of the examples given were easy to follow and they even created situations in which you had to troubleshoot yourself which really helps you understand if you grasp the content or not. There may be a few sections where you either get lost, confused, or simply don't understand. Be sure to take a step back, let that information marinate a bit, revisit the unit/section and definitely code along. Sometimes the information pulls together in future units too so don't get discouraged.I gave this course a 4.5 out of 5 stars only because every now and then with some of the sections some of the coding wouldn't work due to updated libraries/syntax. This is usually pointed out in a note before or after the video with the error which is nice. There was a couple of spots near the end of the bootcamp that had some errors in them but were easily remedied by Googling for help. Which ironically is good practice for any type of development. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is slightly interested in coding, web and app dev, or just to know what it takes to make a website/app."

    "content": "OK - I just finished all of the course content that's available as of this review.  I'm leaving a 5 star rating, and I'll explain why below - but I do have several issues with the course as it is. Let me just briefly touch on my background - I've studied HTML, CSS, and Javascript on my own, some limited experience in Bootstrap and jQuery, but by no means even remotely confident at either of those.That latter point still remains largely true after finishing this course, but I do feel a lot more confident about starting a project and utilizing the appropriate docs to get the job done than I did before, so that's a big plus. Let me get the bad stuff out of the way first -1.  This course is not finished.  The amount of content here, and the presentation beats anything I've found so far, especially in terms of clarity of explanation, so it gets a 5 star review anyway.  It's actually a little sad because this thing could've been even more amazing.  I'd pay for a PART 2 course, even.2. It seems like Ian will be finishing the course.  In the couple of videos he presents, he doesn't explain things as well as Colt does.  Colt explains with the assumption that the listener is pretty green, quite literally - sometimes he over-explains to the point where it's as if he assumes the listener is an actual vegetable.   This is not a criticism, this is a GOOD, GOOD, thing.  This really hammered things home.  Ian speaks as if you are a little more of a coder, and he ends up copying and pasting a lot of stuff, which I didn't appreciate.  Going forward, to keep up with that consistency, he might consider Colt's style.  Ellie's videos are more similar in presentation to Colt, but he seems a bit wooden in his delivery - but in the Closures lecture, he seems a bit more organic, and so if he continues to lecture here, I'm sure he's not got much to go to match Colt.I never utilized the Q&A really, but I did appreciate that Ian seemed quite responsive, so that's a great thing. A few times I did have some issues, but those questions had usually already been asked, so no complaints.OK, enough bickering, what did I actually like?  Quite a bit.I finally feel like I've got a solid understanding of RESTful practices and HTTP requests, something that had me scratching my head before this course, and something that I truthfully thought I would never grasp.  A++I feel more comfortable using APIs, and JSON data - this is an area that would be great to expand on in a part 2 course.  ANodeJS - I'm much more comfortable with this that I was before - at 0 experience, so naturally so, and this course has me excited to keep on learning about it.  NPM packages, ditto. A++Heroku and git, and github - I've wondered about these for a long, long time, and I feel like I have a pretty good foundation going forward on them, and I'm excited about that.  A++Probably the most important thing here - I feel like Colt's style really gets you thinking like a developer, making incremental changes, testing, backing up your data, cleaning up, leaving relevant comments in your stuff - that can't be stressed enough.  A++Ellie's last little bit was also pretty dang helpful in starting to understand the more advanced JS topics that I'd come across but aren't usually touched in introductory material - so very much appreciated for that little overview.  And I'm excited to learn more there, as well.  A nice way to whet your appetite for sure.All in all, at the time of writing this, this is the best education resource I've come across for web development, and trust when I say, I've tried quite a bit of it.  I'm not knocking that other stuff, I learned a lot from it (as a result I flew through the early videos at 1.25, 1.5 and sometimes even 2x speed) but this course can turbo charge that.  I highly recommend it."

Colt did an outstanding job of clearly demonstrating each topic and reiterating its placement and importance within a larger project.  I found this to be essential to my overall understanding.  Also, it was great that Ian was highly active with Q&A along with keeping students informed of critical details along the way.  Many courses do a good job of explaining the \"what and how\" regarding each concept, including what the concept accomplishes and how it is coded, but putting those concepts together within the context of a larger project really helped me understand the \"when and why\" of each concept, clearly teaching when and why each concept is used within a larger project.  In my opinion, this is what sets this course apart.  It was absolutely worth the investment of time and money.   I'm grateful to Colt, Ian, and others for providing this excellent course.  Since this course is continuously updated, I would recommend a future section discussing employment search, interviewing tips, and related topics in order to help students achieve the ultimate goal of being hired.  This would certainly be the icing on the cake!  :)"

You get tons of value from this course and it will work for absolute beginners and those who have some prior knowledge.Colt (the teacher) is fantastic, engaging and keeps you motivated. The tools and concepts taught are relevant and you learn by some cool examples projects. The main project you will complete is something you can build on, which is great.If you want to learn about web development but don't know where to get started - this is the course for you. You really can't go wrong with this course. With this course you also won't waste time on an outdated technology stack. The stack used in the course is highly relevant and you get tons of resources out there, which you can build on after you have completed the course.I also felt that the choice of a Javascript based stack makes a lot of sense - you will struggle to avoid learning Javacript if you are serious about writing code for the web.Why I haven't given it 5 stars? I felt that towards the end some of the concepts used could have been better explained and the advanced Javascript (the tricky stuff) section was completely out of context for me (this is about 10 units out of 330, so a tiny portion).The examples in this section are very abstract compared to the rest of the course and hence, a bit hard to transfer >> this should be improved by teaching this section with more practical examples e.g. advanced features in YelpCamp (the main course project).And, Colt - please add some 'goodbye' video to the end - you disappear very abruptly and without warning from the videos towards the end. After having spent endless hours with you in class, this is very hard to comprehend as a student ... but, where did he go??? :)Seriously - this course is awesome. Get it and complete it!"

The technology seen is up to date and super relevant, tutorials are up to date, and the attention from the T.A. Ian, in case you have doubts, is excellent. I really want to see more courses from these guys cause they really are the best and If you are reading this and deciding whether to take it or not (apart that it was 100% worth it) take the course having the 60 days refund and see for your self if the course is good or not.Overall, It exceeded my expectations, excellent course!!"

I answered the  interview questions without trouble and I did the task I received as second part of the interview from start to finish thanks to this course. Thank you Colt and thank you Ian for creating such a great course!"

He's a solid dude you can tell he's been doing this for a good while, and not only that he's very considerate of the learner. He goes step by step showing you the ins and outs of the language or framework or library your working with and most importantly for my style of learning he explains the why. Why we do it this way instead of this way why I put code in this order instead of this order why seeding the database can be useful at times. Another awesome thing is if you have a question you can expect an answer in the Q&A section. This is a really nice course I highly recommend it to those of you feel intimidated by the mere idea of learning about server-side programming or those of you who are new to writing code in general. You won't learn everything there is to know about javascript or anything like that but the amount of concepts and materials covered is extensive and you'll have the tools you need to keep making and learning how to make dope stuff. P.S the instructor keeps the course up to date"

But there were a few (important) things that flew over my head. Going through the HTML and CSS sections and doing all the exercises was not only fun but helped me understand it so much better. This course stays great consistently. Right now, I am on the backend section. I have never learned backend before, however, Colt explains things so well.

However, I feel that the really distinctive factor that made this course shine is Ian, the course's Teaching Assistant.Throughout the duration of the course, Ian will unfailingly respond to any queries you have, no matter how small or simple (usually within 24 hours as well so you're never stuck on a segment of the course for too long). He is able to pinpoint your problems/the bug in your code even with the little information he is given, and he always takes the time to make sure that he has understood your question correctly before replying.If you want to learn all about webdev from the ground up and you're stuck choosing between the many webdev courses that Udemy offers, then I would suggest you to take this one. The course focuses solely on getting you to improve your programming skills, and does not try to sell anything or deviate into making you the next big startup/entrepreneur. Despite being 40-or-so hours long, it absolutely does not drag out at any point, and coupled with Colt's simple yet excellent explanations as well as Ian's dedication to his role as a TA, you truly get what you paid for."

Not anymore.  The Web Developer Bootcamp provides an outstanding, in-depth, well-paced overview of the core technologies needed to build web applications from start to finish.  And not only that, but most of the course is hands-on, walking me through the steps to making a large project but also encouraging me to leverage other peoples' code and knowledge to be more effective.As I approach the end of the course, I can see some subjects that I feel are very important for developing web applications professionally, but aren't covered.  In particular, the course would benefit from more emphasis on strategies for dealing with the asynchronous operations typical of server code (JavaScript promises and Mongo pre/post data hooks, for instance).It is a testament to the course's quality and breadth of coverage, however, that I felt confident in my ability to learn and apply techniques that seemed to be missing from the curriculum.Overall, the course doesn't quite get me from web developer neophyte to professional.  But it's a rock-solid foundation to build on."

Colt provides great introductions and summaries around the pieces of content that he teaches, which ensures that the students understand what they are supposed to be learning. If ever we missed something, we can go back and watch that part of the lesson again.Some ending videos are presented by Ian and Elie. Those are good, but not as engaging as the lessons presented by Colt. Still it is easy to learn what Ian and Elie are presenting. (And I have to say that, once I got used to Elie, he was easy to follow too.)Overall, the course was intense and amazing, and a great value for the sale price. I will look for other courses by Colt and Elie in the future."

The addition of Git and website deployment modules adds a nice touch and gives an idea about what happens after development.

Towards the end, I found a few lectures missing on topics Colt says he would to cover, like integration of Google Maps, introduction to GitHub, etc. but I don't think that's a deal breaker. You can actually take it as an assignment to do some research and teach yourself those minor topics.All the concepts are explained thoroughly. He also takes the extra effort of explaining why something should not be done by deliberately making the mistake and elaborating on it. Colt manages to keep the course interesting throughout and teaches the topics which are currently sought after by the recruiters. This helped me as a student to be engrossed in the lectures and not lose focus. I would definitely recommend this course to an aspiring web developer with zero knowledge on web technologies.Thanks for the amazing course Colt!"

Since I'm still early on in the course, my praise might be a bit diluted; however, this already appears to be better than any other resource I have experienced to learning web development.  Excellent course, and the instructor speaks very clearly and at a good pace.  The reason I didn't rate the full 5 is because there is definitely some filler that can be cut out.By the time I finished up the Javascript part of the course and basic DOM, I have already learned more about web development than I ever have before.  Next review update will likely come after jQuery.Learning jQuery from Colt was a wonderful experience.  It made understanding the DOM extremely simple, and following it up with the ToDo list project was even more helpful.  Working on the Patatap clone now, and I look forward to getting into the remainder of the course!Finally finished the whole course.  Easily the most helpful full-stack web development course I've ever taken.  When going through the user-authentication stuff with Passport, it would have been nice if Colt had explained that you can add properties to the User object, and how to use Passport beyond simply username, salt, and hash; however, deployment was quick and easy, and it was simple enough to set up a local MongoDB instance with node as opposed to on Cloud9.  Would highly, highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to start learning full-stack web development."

    "content": "Web design is certainly one of the more difficult subjects to teach comprehensively.  It is compartmentalized modularly over so many different languages, each dedicated to a separate small component of overall functionality, causing a beginner to have to completely come to a halt in one aspect of their learning & start over with a whole other process, then learn how the languages integrate & communicate to make a better, more informed end product.  Every iteration of change takes years to come into common practice acceptable for standardized usage, & years more have to go by to see more outdated & troubling practices fall into obsolescence.  That said, Colt does quite a good job of abstracting out so much that can confuse people getting into web design while they're getting the hang of the important formative concepts, & breaking down what's happening as it makes sense to discuss without alienating much of the audience.  He also keeps the course well updated, & a studious eye will clearly see the care taken to the delivery of that process.  Overall, I agree with most of the decisions taken on which languages & what direction as it made for a fairly helpful course in streamlining what hoops need to be jumped through being greatly mitigated. My personal goal in taking this course was in furthering my knowledge of backend development, & I do feel some of the content therein does still come up short though, as it still doesn't quite cover foundational principles thoroughly enough.  A good emphasis in this course is placed, early & often, on the importance of searching for your own answers with the whole of the internet before coming here, and while that is an important skill every professional needs, the competence required to narrow results to be more pertinent & ability to legibly sift through results to more pertinently find what one is looking for is often overlooked, and it often requires a thorough knowledge of nomenclature which requires that most basic understanding of low level, core concepts to achieve.  I do think the teaching of this course takes an appreciation of that fact, but many sections towards the backend simply aren't there yet in delivering on those core concepts, & although some are stated as planned, I have no idea when to expect to see any of it.Most odd to me is the complete omission of XAMPP stacks as they are certainly the more classic approach which will teach much of that basic understanding, even if there are many modern alternatives which are more competitive to be skilled in, but even then, when opting instead in favor of teaching a MEAN stack flow (overall, a far superior option for beginners to learn on, certainly), not even covering what Angular is, what it's good for, or why it's not in the course seems odd when it's definitely a standard component people learning this way will need to be familiar with to get work.I definitely sorely missed the promised section which the introductory auth section alluded to coming at the end, which would teach it from the ground up without passport, as most of all in backend I feel insecure about handling others' sensitive information & claiming to be a working professional, and I was hoping the auth section would cover more about encryption techniques & best practices, and a from scratch auth section seemed like it'd be a great place to cover many of the core concepts there.I could see most of the LAMP backend as being optional  at best would make more sense, but MySQL for one I'd say is more foundational than that.  While the database section covers MongoDB adequately for someone to use it, I did not feel it did an adequate job for me to feel comfortable administrating one, as there was no talk about database backup or restore, file I/O, or really any tools that would help in keeping you in charge of managing your own data thoroughly, and overall, I really felt a compartmentalized, part SQL database would have better illustrated the core differences with a relational database versus a non relational one, albeit a more convoluted process for people to understand.  MySQL is pretty foundational & important, and it could have started with MySQL for the content that fit well into a relational database, then expanded into MongoDB in a later section for the content which is better stored in a non-relational style, have the 2 link together after that, & better teach principles along the way.File I/O is also a really important section to cover in general whether that's the preferred approach to database management or not that I feel was totally skipped, & could at least be touched upon in yelpcamp by adding avatar uploads, then...some feature which I honestly don't have an idea for a feature to offer IN yelpcamp for a reason for iterating over an external file's contents & reading that into the database somehow.Anyhow, I'm obviously picky, I just consider a bootcamp something more comprehensive than is quite here so far.  Still overall a very worthwhile course for your time & money: it's concise, thorough enough to get yourself started, & to the point.  I just hope more of that content is what's planned on the way."

The real value Colt delivers is _integration_. If you buy other courses or books, then they mostly focus on a single technology. For someone who wants to start learning web development, all of the names of the technology are frustrating, but this course has put it down to a single place. For the amount you pay, this course is worth taking. But then why do I not give 5 stars? Well, there are a few places that should be re-recorded; a couple of videos (two in the intermediate JavaScript) are audio-muted, and the video on github code backtracking is unfocused. Also, ideas are not easy to follow when Colt explains only with source code: it would have been much better if he had made use of charts and diagrams when explaining ideas (e.g. connect-flash). However, they are not deal-breakers. The course really is worth your time and money to get started with learning to develop a web application. Thank you, Colt. Great job!"

    "content": "This was a fantastic course and I wouldn't change it in any way, except perhaps to leave out the last section on \"JavaScript - The Weird Stuff\" because after an intense Node.js learning experience it feels like backtracking by having a detailed discussion about the different ways to use 'this' in JavaScript.I wish I had more to say but that's it. This was a fantastic learning experience!And THE BEST course I have taken on Udemy.I have taken many courses on a variety of subjects and about 5 courses so far on programming, including a very in-depth Bootcamp that focused on PHP rather than Node.THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE!The reason it is the best course is because Colt teaches in a clear manner, and the coding challenges, code-alongs and main project (YelpCamp) are at the appropriate level for the instructions offered just before the challenge.Also, he outlines EVERYTHING beforehand which I find extremely helpful.What I mean by that is that he (1) gives you a syllabus at the beginning, and then (2) at the beginning of each section he offers an overview of what will be learned in that section and then (3) at the beginning of most videos he outlines the main points of that specific video/lesson.When I know what is coming it makes it easier for me to remember the main takeaway concepts while I am learning, and also helps me to review if I get stuck on a topic in the future.I also love that there was one LARGE project and that each part of building that large project related to a number of mini-projects that were offered beforehand, as practice, before messing with the code on the large project.This was great because the repetition of building each page in the mini-project helped in the large YelpCamp site because it reinforced the specific code and where it goes.Again, this repetition helps me to retain the information.I can easily see myself using the course again to build a site that is something I am into, like favorite books or favorite movies. This would reinforce the process and if I did it enough I feel that this course is comprehensive enough for me to consider myself proficient in this Node stack as long as I got to the point where I was coding without assistance from the videos.My point is that there is a ton of information in this course and totally worth every dollar and every minute I devoted to it.Colt has a great sense of humor and I love Rusty. They made a potentially dry and complicated subject very fun! Also, Ian (the T.A.) is fantastic and very quick to respond to questions. I highly recommend reading the questions from other students for each video just for fun and extra learning.If you are really interested in learning JavaScript to operate both front-end and back-end web development, this is a fantastic step in that direction!"

    "content": "Just finished this huge course. I remember what Colt said at the very first lecture: \"This will be the only course you'll ever need to learn web development.\" At that time and in that mindset, I thought I was literally going to learn everything about web development I'll ever need to learn from this course. That was a rookie thought, I can tell now. This course does not teach you everything you need to know on web development(surprise), but it teaches you something much more valuable: learning how to learn. It may seem funny at first, but as the course went far I realized one of the most important aspect of being a successful developer is not the language in which you write or the framework you use, it's how fast you can adapt to specific environments and tools using simply information on the internet and information on the given tool's docs and other sources. As Colt introduces new tools and environments, he actually takes us to the docs, various forums and searches for specific information on a given topic. While doing side projects on my own, I found myself of lurking in the docs of a tool and pinning the exact information I need rather that searching for a tutorial on Youtube or somewhere else as the old me would do. This made me realize where I got this habit from, and it made me love the course even more. In short, I highly recommend this series to anyone who aspires to become a web developer and wishes to have the right mindset for the skill."

    "content": "Currently about two thirds through the course. I must say I am very impressed so far and will give a summary of two areas i feel is worth discussing.Updates and support. Some of the videos seem a bit outdated by now, however the resources used are frequently updated and it might be hard to keep up. To tackle this issue however, there are exellent support in the QA aswell as notes to inform of bigger changes that might impact the current lesson. Overall it works just smoothly. And concerning the support in the QA it has so far resolved any problem and bug i have run in to so far, by only reading the replies of already asked questions. So overall, a big +.Course quality. The only con here is also one of my biggest pro's. There are no pauses or grandpa-paced typing, making it hard to keep up and code along. There is however a pause button, and once you put up your workspace in a different program/window, you can easily tab>space to keep up. This can be a bit annoying in very information heavy sections when you have to tab pause every other second and sometimes jump back half a minute because you lost focus of the entirety of what you just wrote.. however those fast and compact videos lets you pick your own pace (which is great when reaching out to a big crowd), even if it can be a little bothersome sometimes.  But best of all is that you realise that those hours of video in this course is CONTENT, and nothing else pretty much. Just pure content for you to absorb.. and very good content for that matter!These are the two areas i felt was most important to express to anyone thinking about buying this course. And in addition to what I wrote above, this course is awsome. Great content, great resources and the resources used are ofter referred to as \"optional\",  but is thoroughly explained why just that resource was chosen. Video quality is great, sound is great, everything is just above any expectation I had. If you want to start now, pick it up at full price. If you are still unsure, wait for a sale. In the end I feel like this course is worth several times the full price. It's a steal, no matter when you buy it!"

I waited until after completing the final stage of YelpCamp to get a feel for the entire course before even considering writing a review. With that being said, here it is...Colt, without a doubt, is the best online teacher I have witnessed. I have tried searching far and wide for a course to cover the specific topics that he covers, and found none even remotely close to what he and his team has created. Not just the content itself, but how it is put together. Everything is done by building upon previous lessons learned, and it is all done in a clear and concise manner.Although Colt does deserve a great deal of credit, his TA cannot be forgotten. Ian has not only helped me, but others countless times. The moment you leave a question you can expect a swift and informative response. He has also been willing to review my code when I got caught up in a bind which helped greatly throughout the course. I could go on writing a novel about how amazing this course is, but would rather keep it short. Simply put, Colt and Ian have inspired me to continue learning as well as motivated me to keep pushing in the future. I can only dream about being as knowledgeable as them, and would hope to cross paths in the future."

    "content": "GREAT course. I've learned quickly with this as a guide to important parts of web development (I AM the kind to update reviews as needed so if this is not updated, then I am still happy with it). UPDATE (6/19/2017): I'm on about lecture 198 and am still very happy with what I'm learning. It helps a LOT to pause the video and play, THEN see what the teacher did. It also helps a lot to note the resources and where you can find them; walk through the process of finding them yourself rather than just copy the teacher. You will then have your list of resources (notes, links, whatever) to which you can return later.BEGINNERS will love the explanations of basic things (such as concepts of a variable and loops). I'm more experienced at programming (C++, Java) and I already knew HTML, so I skipped a lot. Yet, I had to be careful not to miss components that I didn't know like differences in JavaScript's handling of arrays, strings (immutable... WTH) and weak typing traps. So, those with experience can skip, but it could have been even faster if alternate lessons had been presented with the assumption of knowing basic concepts. No matter though, Colt is great at explaining, 1.5x speed helped me a LOT, and skipping saved tons of time. (When I'm following some coding or it's something on which I must focus heavily, I can switch bath to 1x speed (and it feels like slow motion then). OPTIONAL DETAILS: The somewhat bad side (but not really too bad, so no detractions for it): The goofs in the videos are \"corrected\" by notes just before the section. While good to know, that timing made it a little cumbersome. I'd rather someone edit the video, even if it's just a note on the screen, so I get it when I need it, and not before. I disliked having to return to it later. It was a little disruptive. ALSO, every now and then a core concept was not explained. For example, a higher order function (delayed execution) is given a second parameter, and there was no explanation that forEach is designed such that the first function reference can optionally be given this 2nd parameter for the index. A beginner will likely be baffled (if she thought of it anyway) as to how the variable was incremented. It's because forEach will update this optional parameter (and allows a third optional parameter for the list - also never mentioned). This should at least be put in a text sidebar on the video. It'd be nice to also reference the possibility of doing these with the arrow functions (like Java's lambda expressions) so a user could play with it. This is a perfectly acceptable form of a higher order functions and one will likely encounter them. So I played with that and completed some assignments with it. One cannot cover everything though, and Cort does a great job including most important concepts.Overall, I'm very happy with the course, and highly recommend it."

    "content": "Overall, an excellent introduction to full stack development with Node.js. Colton has a good teaching style it was easy to follow along in the videos. Compared to other courses, this one is definitely one of the best Iâ€™ve taken so far.  The additional tutorials on JavaScript were of great help in learning the language. It's also quite long and so I recommend completing one full section per day so that you can absorb the material at a decent pace.Some issuesâ€¦ YelpCamp tutorial is not mobile friendly, which is both disappointing and surprising, considering building responsive websites is very important.  Building for mobile first should take precedence. The student can of course fix this but I would like a complete example to base future work on.  Also, the course is somewhat incomplete.  The YelpCamp exercise needs additional work to complete the UI, as well as provide responsiveness for mobile web browsers. It would also be nice to add a feature where, if an area requires login, that after logging in, the user is taken directly to where they were previously, rather then requiring drill-down again.Some recommendationsâ€¦Shift away from Cloud 9 due to its requirements for sign-up. Learning about this tool is highly beneficial and I recommend keeping it for one section, but shift the user back to their own command-line.  Suggest using an editor such as Atom or perhaps Sublime. Teach Git just after HTML, CSS, and intro to JavaScript.  It provides a way to undo.  I think it is bad practice to create copies of the YelpCamp code for v1, v2, v3, etc, when Git should serve this purpose using tags or branches. Show new students the benefit of branching and tagging early on.  Show how to create the version tags and how to checkout earlier versions of YelpCamp if necessary.I highly suggest taken this course if you want to be a full-stack developer. The course has a nice pace to it and you build a foundation in front-end development first and then move on to back-end development. The instructor makes reference to documentation frequently which is what you will need to do during your development process."
