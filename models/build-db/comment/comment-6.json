He also does a very thorough job in explaining the \"why\" during the coding exercises .  You will not only learn Node.js but get a deep understanding of Node related topics.  The first half of the course in more theoretical and lays a good foundation for the hand-on coding exercises that he walks through.  I highly recommend this course for anyone who is interesting in learning Node.  This should be your first course in Node."

Full of bloat, background knowledge and good-to-know information.A ton of theoretical information about Javascript, the C++ V8 engine without much practice on using actual NodeJS.Examples are often confusing due to confusing naming of methods and variables. Not to mention he teaches the outdated ways of creating an object first before telling you that there's actually an easier, newer way (ES6) without having to touch prototypes, constructors and inheritance, called the class keyword. But even as someone who is sufficiently experienced in programming, it was a HUGE PAIN to reach there, I can't imagine how much more demoralising than it should have been for a beginner, not knowing what's really important, to pick all these up at one go.More focus should be on quickly building an actual app and not about the design patterns. All that should be in a separate course.UPDATE: So I just completed the course, I felt it was just trash. There's no focus as to what he is trying to teach, frequently digressing with \"Conceptual Asides\" and lame \"Big Word Alerts\" that trivialise the viewer's intelligence. It touches on many other aspects such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, frontend frameworks like AngularJS, and React.js, touches a little bit on CDNs, skims through some jQuery, SQL queries, CSS, and did pretty much shallow coverage on what NodeJS has to offer. It even has a lecture that tries to teach you how to be a Full-Stack developer when the course is really about NodeJS!What's worse, the course is not even complete yet and it remains incomplete since the day I purchased it with zero updates. Ridiculous.Please don't buy this course. Save yourself some money and effort, look for something else.- From a fellow full-stack web developer."

They are great for understanding what's going on when you feel like you're swimming in too much new information that other courses on here will throw at you. I personally feel more comfortable learning from the bottom up. I would suggest that you supplement with another Node course though as well so that you don't just learn a ton of concepts at once that don't really have much relevance to you if you haven't done anything in Node. This way, you can feel free to pick up a fast paced, project heavy course and switch back and forth between the two incrementally.  This will help not only with understanding how to apply what you're learning as you go so that it sinks in, but you can move forward knowing that you're ready for new concepts."

He is not replying anybody's questions any more and the codebase in the course is outdated (old version of nodejs used). What's more I found several errors in source code of examples. That leaves very bad testimony about the lecturers engagement and not treating students like idiots."

How each technology fits into the whole was clearly presented throughout the course.

This course is an absolute must for those wanting to truly understand Node.js and related technologies.  10 stars!!!!   :)"

I found myself impatient in the early sections of this course.  However, the refreshers and the \"oh wow I didn't know it did that\" moments really helped when we finally take the dive into Node.  My advice to anyone taking this course is to pay attention even when the content may seem trivial.  Just from taking this course I have found I know more about JavaScript than even some Senior Developers that I work along side.  On top of that I have a great grasp on what Node is trying to do.

What is UTF-8?\".Unfortunately I knew them all and what I needed was simply a course introducing the main concepts of Node, possibly understanding them under the hood. I actually learned them by attending it, but with a big burden of paying attention to tons of things a basic web developer already must know. Plus, so many asides can make lose to the main focus IMHO! I recommend the course  only to those who are not I.T. professionals and want to start coding in node as well as gaining some fundamentals (that will not be sufficient for a well-skilled I.T., but will be ok for starters and understanding Node!)."
