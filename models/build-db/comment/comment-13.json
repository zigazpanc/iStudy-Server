The digital portion may be difficult if a person doesn't have basic knowledge on the various digital platforms out there.I felt that the lectures could do better with Powerpoint slides rather than highlighting with the cursor. It would also be more complete if Instagram and LinkedIn can be included in the course.Overall, a good course to get a basic to intermediate understanding of marketing on the various digital platforms."

I absolutely recommend it to ANYONE as it is a vital skill to have nowadays in the job market and guess what?!! you never know when your path might change and when your next big thing come along your way and you'd NEED this.

Also, it'd be better if we got to know how to use Ahrefs and SEMRush in details. In copywriting too, it'd be appreciated if get to learn how to write a press release and pitch journalists. If these things could be covered in details, this course will be the best and doubt Daragh is so sweet and helpful.As a beginner's course, it is the best. Highly Recommended!!!! :)"

For someone who is motivated, there are lots of other resources out there, but a newbie won't really find all the small steps needed to follow along.Overall, the course was really comprehensive and did a great job covering a wide range of topics any beginner would struggle with. It won't make you an expert at any, but enough meat there to get minimally up to speed on all of it.Highly recommended!"

Thank you very much! Even as a Commerce & Marketing student I found lots of new info about the practical part of digital marketing and many actionable items in it. You could've dive into more detail at some topics, but I'd highly recommend this course to anybody who is interested in the core principles of digital marketing and didn't know where to start."
