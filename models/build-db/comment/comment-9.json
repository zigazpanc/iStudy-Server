I already knew most of it, thankfully, but managed to pick up a few new tricks. I can say that this course covers material from a couple of accounting courses, finance courses, and an intermediate course of Excel. You have to know the basics of Excel before taking this course to get the most out of it, and there are plenty of Udemy courses that can teach you that.What this course has done for me is give me confidence that I have the skills and knowledge to do the job, and I am pursuing a new position now. The free job hunting guide is helpful in this endeavor."

There is a lot of useful information in this course, however, much of it was a little bit basic compared to what I had expected and been looking for. With it being a complete financial analyst course, I expected it to go into more depth on many topics. I would suggest this course would be more effective if it were broken up into two separate courses, with the first one covering the basic excel functions and accounting/finance background info, and then a second course that would go more in depth with more complicated financial modelling, etc. That way, those with a finance background do not have to go through all the basic fundamentals. For someone just starting out in finance though, this course explains the concepts in a very easy to understand manner. Overall a solid course though."
