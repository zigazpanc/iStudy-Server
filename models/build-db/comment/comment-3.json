    "content": "His content is almost great, I have a really hard time following him because he shows you how to not code something, then shows you how. I personally learn a lot from my first experience coding something, and would hate to constantly make errors. His examples are great apps that go pretty in depth with angular. He also does some things in coding-wise that bothers me in particular, like same line curly braces for classes and methods, but that's all coding conventions. There's also sometimes where he is doing some coding that I'm trying to follow along with, but when he switches to another file he just says \"now lets switch to the template\" despite not telling you which template to switch to(yes i know we're workin on the same component, but sometimes it gets confusing as an angular beginner) it gets on my nerves, but yet again not that big of a problem, but does slow down the learning process on my end. Edit It's a very good reference of code, so I gave it a 5/5"

    "content": "Here is my honest review on the course. Easily, 5 star deserving. The sheer duration of the course, ~22 hours itself is an indication of how in depth the course is and how much the instructor is dedicated in passing across, to the students the best possible content. I have other courses from Max and he make sure almost all aspects are covered in his courses which makes every penny worth of your spent money. I would have liked it more, if there was an intro on FormBuilder, barelling of files, and few of the advanced topics like ngRx or ng2-store as most of the heavy angular 2 apps need state management and ample solid one stop references are not available sadly.  This course will easily be the angular 2 bible if such contents too is included. Awaiting more content and more courses from max! One tip to the other students / people looking to buy:If you want to get the best out of the course, dont recreate the recipe / shopping example max had done as is. Instead, use some css framework, ( bootstrap/ zurb/ bootswatch ), create your own example , say a book store, or a sports-store, take only the concepts and ideas from the course & build the same in parallel.  It took me almost a month to cover 90% of the content in this course, but at the end, i felt confident of getting fully hands on with angular 4 challenges!"
